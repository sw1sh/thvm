# ENIGMA dataset + guidance experiment harness

Tooling for the ATP machine-learned guidance roadmap
([docs/plans/atp_ml_roadmap.md](../../docs/plans/atp_ml_roadmap.md)): build a
proof corpus, train the Tier-2 GNN proof-relevance scorer, and measure
GNN-guided critical-pair reranking.

Everything runs through `wl -t SEC -f script` (the fast WL CLI, `-t` self-kills
its kernel on timeout so a runaway leaves no orphan), one job at a time, so a
diverging or memory-heavy proof cannot accumulate kernels and pressure the host.

## Environment

- `ATP_DATA` -- scratch dir for datasets + scorers (default `/tmp/enigma`).
  Layout: `ds/` (AxiomaticTheory `.wxf`), `tptp_ds/` (TPTP `.wxf`),
  `proved.wl` (theory -> proved-theorem-name map), `*.safetensors` (scorers).
- `TPTP_ROOT` -- TPTP install root (so `include('Axioms/..')` resolves).

## Scripts

| script | what |
|---|---|
| `prove_one_tptp.wls` | prove one TPTP `.p`, emit proof-essential lemmas as a labelled graph `.wxf` (positives) |
| `tptp_build.sh <list> [out]` | per-problem TPTP build over a list of `.p` paths, resumable |
| `prove_theory.wls` | build the graph dataset for one AxiomaticTheory's proved NotableTheorems (pos+neg) |
| `build_all_safe.sh` | build all fast AxiomaticTheory datasets, one theory per `wl -t` |
| `merge_train.wls <out>` | merge ds/ + tptp_ds/, balance, train a small GNN scorer |
| `verify_fix.wls` | train the bigger GNN on the FULL dataset (minibatched, memory-bounded; issue #8) |
| `loop_measure.wls <scorer> <period> <maxSteps> <out>` | A/B solved-within-budget, rerank on vs off |
| `loop_timed.wls <period> <maxSteps>` | timed A/B (wall + solved) on a fixed theorem set |
| `rss_probe.wls` | peak-RSS probe of the minibatched big-model train (issue #8) |

`period 1e9` in the measure scripts effectively disables reranking (baseline).

## Typical flow

```
export TPTP_ROOT=/path/to/TPTP-v9.2.1 ATP_DATA=/tmp/enigma
tools/atp_enigma/build_all_safe.sh                                  # AxiomaticTheory datasets
tools/atp_enigma/tptp_build.sh ueq_problems.txt                     # TPTP datasets
wl -t 450 -f tools/atp_enigma/verify_fix.wls                        # train the corpus scorer
wl -t 200 -f tools/atp_enigma/loop_timed.wls 200 800                # measure guided vs baseline
```
