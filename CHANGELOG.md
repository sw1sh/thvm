dated section.

## Unreleased

### Added: DUP-LAM + church-numeral examples

- `src/interact/dup_lam.c`: real DUP-LAM rule.  Allocates one
  five-cell block holding the new pair of bound vars (as a SUP
  inside the original binder) and the new pair of body projections
  (as a fresh DUP over the original body).  No body cloning happens
  eagerly -- only when a future projection inspects part of the
  body does it descend lazily.  This is the rule that gives Church
  numerals (and similarly Lamping / optimal-reduction style
  workloads) their non-exponential cloning behaviour.
- `tests/test_dup_lam.c`: two C tests; clone an identity lambda and
  confirm DUP-LAM fires once, then end-to-end apply one of the
  cloned copies to ERA.
- `wl/Examples/10-k-combinator/`, `11-church-1/`, `12-church-2/`,
  `13-church-2-applied/`: four new runnable examples.  The Church 2
  family exercises the DUP machinery; the applied form reduces
  end-to-end and the resulting graph (in `13-...-applied/graph.png`)
  shows the post-firing heap including the cloned lambdas and the
  substituted DUP cell.
- Two new VerificationTests in `wl/THVMLink/Tests/core.wlt`: a
  direct DUP-LAM clone, and Church-2-applied reducing to the
  identity-applied result.
- `docs/interact/dup_lam.md` documents the rule, the C, the cost,
  and why the lazy-cloning shape matters.

### Added: visualization renderer split + theme-aware colors

- `wl/THVMLink/Kernel/Visualization.wl`: extracts the heap-graph
  renderer into a dedicated kernel sibling.  THVMLink.wl now `Get`s
  it after declaring public symbols.
- Theme-aware colors throughout: `LightDarkSwitched[Black, White]`
  for foreground; `Lighter[StandardX, 0.55]` / `Darker[StandardX,
  0.45]` per-tag agent fills (green LAM, blue APP, orange SUP,
  purple DUP); ERA stays as a plain foreground-stroked Circle.
- Vertex labels now render in column form: `TAG\n@<base>` for
  arity-1 agents, `TAG\n@<base>..<base+1>` for arity-2.
- Triangles are real triangles via `Triangle[]` (not trapezoids)
  with apex orientation matching IC convention: LAM/DUP point down,
  APP/SUP point up.
- VertexShapeFunction now respects the size argument so
  `VertexSize -> Tiny | Small | Large | Scaled[...]` actually take
  effect.
- Single-vertex self-loop is drawn explicitly via
  EdgeShapeFunction; the identity lambda's loop is now visible.
- Pink "background" mystery solved: `Dashing[{Small, Small}]` was
  invalid (Small is not a numeric Dashing arg) which silently put
  Wolfram into an error-overlay state.  Replaced with the proper
  `Dashed` directive.
- Context-shadowing fix: switched `wl/Examples/run.wls` and
  `wl/THVMLink/Tests/run.wls` from `Needs["THVMLink`"]` to
  `Get["THVMLink`"]` so user code resolves to package symbols
  rather than auto-created `Global`*` placeholders.
- `wl/GUIDE.md` gains a Dark-mode + Standard colors section and an
  OptionsPattern[] section.

### Added: TTerm atomic wrapper + ensureInit

- TTerm[id_Integer] is the canonical wrapper around a packed Term;
  TLam / TApp / TSup / TDup / TEra / TVarFor return TTerm-wrapped
  values; TTermTag/Ext/Val/Sub accept either a TTerm or a raw
  Integer.  Old TTermInfo is gone (folded into TTerm[id]["info"]);
  TTermNew is no longer in the public API (private packTerm helper).
- TTerm[id]["tag" | "ext" | "val" | "sub" | "tagName" | "raw" |
  "info"] forwards to the bridge.  Format.wl gives TTerm a summary
  box keyed off the structural pattern (QuantumFramework style).
- ensureInit[]: heap-touching ops auto-call TInit if the runtime is
  not initialised yet.  TFree clears the flag.

### Added: wl/Examples/ runnable example database

- New `wl/Examples/` directory: one folder per example term, each
  holding a minimal `term.wl` (no `Needs`, no `TInit`, just the
  expression to construct the term) plus the rendered
  `graph.png` produced by the runner.
- 9 examples covering every interaction we currently fire: identity
  lambda, (id ERA) before / after `TWnf`, (ERA lam) before / after
  `TWnf`, bare `TSup[ERA, ERA]`, DUP-SUP same-label annihilation
  before / after, and nested APPs.
- `wl/Examples/run.wls`: single CLI for both bulk and per-example
  runs.  Loads the paclet, calls `TInit` per example, evaluates the
  `term.wl`, exports the resulting `THeapGraph[term]` as a PNG
  alongside the source.  Supports a positional example id and a
  `--eval` flag to skip the PNG export.
- `wl/Examples/README.md` catalogues every example and documents how
  to add new ones.
- `make wl-examples` (regenerate every PNG) and
  `make wl-examples EXAMPLE=<id>` (just one).
- `docs/heap_graph.md` now embeds two of those PNGs directly from
  `wl/Examples/<id>/graph.png` so the doc and the runnable example
  stay in sync.  The previous one-off `docs/images/` directory is
  removed.
- `wl/GUIDE.md` gains a rule for multi-line `If`: leading space after
  the bracket so the test argument lines up with the branches
  (`If[ cond, then, else]`).

### Added: heap graph rendering (PLAN.md step 10)

- `THeapGraph[]` and `THeapGraph[term]` (or `THeapGraph[{t1, t2,
  ...}]`) render the runtime as an IC string-diagram Wolfram
  `Graph[]`: compound terms (LAM/APP/SUP/DUP) are agent vertices
  keyed by their args base, VAR cells collapse into wires labelled
  `var`, and ERA cells render as small black dots.  Optional seed
  terms add agents that are heapless (held only as WL return values).
- `THeap[]` now returns an atomic `THeap[<|nextLoc, cells, Graph|>]`
  with the rendered graph at the `"Graph"` key (capitalized).
- `TTermInfo[t]` now returns an atomic `TTermInfo[<|...|>]` with the
  same payload shape.
- Both atomic objects expose Association-style indexing via DownValues
  and forward `KeyExistsQ`/`Keys`/`Values`/`Normal` via UpValues so
  callers see the same access shape as before.
- `wl/THVMLink/Kernel/Format.wl` defines the `MakeBoxes` UpValues
  (QuantumFramework-style: structural Q-test guarded by `Unevaluated`,
  `BoxForm`ArrangeSummaryBox` for the visual).  Loaded from
  `THVMLink.wl` after the public symbols are declared.
- `TFreshLabel[]` returns a fresh integer from a monotonic counter
  (reset by `TReset[]`).  `TSup[a, b]` and `TDup[body, k]` now
  auto-label via `TFreshLabel[]`; the existing 3-arg
  `TSup[label, a, b]` / `TDup[label, body, k]` forms remain for
  tests that need explicit label matching.
- `wl/THVMLink/Tests/core.wlt` gains six new VerificationTests:
  fresh-label monotonicity + TReset rewind, auto-label distinctness
  for both SUP and DUP, identity-lambda `THeapGraph` shape, seeded
  vs unseeded graph for `TApp[id, ERA]` and `TDup[TSup[ERA, ERA], k]`.
- `docs/heap_graph.md` is now the permanent reference for the model
  (agent-as-vertex, VAR-as-wire, ERA-as-dot) with six worked
  snapshots, mermaid diagrams, and live `THeapGraph` PNGs for
  examples 2 and 4 (regenerated by `docs/images/generate.wls`).
- `docs/term.md` gains a glossary table pinning down term / cell /
  loc / slot / agent / args base / port / node / wire and links
  forward to `docs/heap_graph.md`.
- `docs/wl.md` documents the `Format.wl` summary-box layer and the
  layout convention.
- `docs/images/generate.wls` produces the PNGs embedded in the doc;
  `docs/images/` is the canonical location for generated diagrams.

`make test`    -> 91 C checks pass.
`make wl-test` -> 23 WL VerificationTests pass.

### Added: architecture docs (PLAN.md steps 8-9)

- `docs/` with a self-contained markdown per piece, indexed by
  `docs/README.md`:
  - `docs/term.md`: bit layout + tag table + worked examples.
  - `docs/heap.md`: bump allocator + the substitution model
    (`heap_subst_var`, `heap_subst_cop`).
  - `docs/wnf.md`: enter/apply state machine, frame protocol, and
    the dispatch table for current interactions.
  - `docs/interact/_.md`: index of active-pair rules + tracking of
    which active pairs are stuck (deferred).
  - `docs/interact/{app_lam,app_era,dup_sup,dup_era}.md`: one page
    per interaction with the sequent rule, the C, a worked example,
    and a cost summary.
  - `docs/wl.md`: WL paclet design (scalar bridge + WL-side
    constructors) and usage.
- `README.md`: top of the file points at `docs/README.md` and the
  layout block now includes `docs/`.
- `AGENTS.md`: workflow step 4 clarifies that the `docs/interact/`
  page is the source of truth when it disagrees with the C file's
  header comment.

### Added: minimal reducer + interactions (PLAN.md steps 5-6)

- `src/wnf/_.c`: real two-phase stack-machine reducer (enter/apply)
  modeled on HVM4's clang/wnf/_.c.  Pushes APP / DP0 / DP1 frames at
  enter, dispatches active-pair interactions at apply, rebuilds stuck
  nodes by writing the reduced head back into the heap cell.
- `src/interact/app_lam.c`: real APP-LAM beta (`(lam x.body) arg`
  substitutes `arg` at the binder loc and continues into `body`).
- `src/interact/app_era.c`: APP-ERA (erased function yields ERA).
- `src/interact/dup_sup.c`: DUP-SUP same-label annihilation.  The
  commuting (different-label) case is left stuck for now; a test will
  drive the implementation when needed.
- `src/interact/dup_era.c`: DUP-ERA (both projections receive ERA via
  `heap_subst_cop`).
- `src/heap/subst_cop.c`: pair-substitution helper used by both
  DUP-style interactions; substitutes one side and returns the other.
- `src/thvm.h`: declares the new `interact_*` and `heap_subst_cop`
  signatures.
- `tests/test_app_lam.c`, `tests/test_era.c`, `tests/test_dup_sup.c`:
  removed the `PENDING(...)` gates and added ITRS-counter assertions
  so each test verifies the specific interaction fires (and only
  fires once).
- `wl/THVMLink/Tests/core.wlt`: three new VerificationTests covering
  APP-LAM, APP-ERA, and same-label DUP-SUP through the LibraryLink
  bridge.
- `Makefile`: moved `SRC :=` definition above the `$(WL_LIB)` rule so
  `make wl` correctly retriggers when any C runtime file changes.

`make test` -> 91 C checks pass.  `make wl-test` -> 14 WL tests pass.

### Added: WL paclet (PLAN.md step 4)

- `wl/THVMLink/` paclet that exposes the C runtime to Wolfram
  Language, with the LibraryLink bridge in `wl/THVMLink/CSource/`,
  the package in `wl/THVMLink/Kernel/THVMLink.wl`, and tests in
  `wl/THVMLink/Tests/`.
- `wl/THVMLink/CSource/thvmlink.c` exports 14 scalar `EXTERN_C
  DLLEXPORT` functions covering lifecycle (init/free/reset), term
  packing/unpacking (`thvm_wl_term_*`), heap access
  (`thvm_wl_heap_pos/alloc/read/set`), the WNF entry point, and the
  interaction counter. Every function is scalar-in / scalar-out (no
  arrays, no opaque handles).
- `wl/THVMLink/Kernel/THVMLink.wl` synthesizes higher-level term
  constructors (`TLam`, `TApp`, `TSup`, `TDup`) from the scalar
  primitives via shared `heapWith` / `heapTerm` helpers, plus the
  inspector `TTermInfo` and the heap snapshot `THeap[]`.
- `wl/THVMLink/Tests/core.wlt` defines 11 `VerificationTest` specs
  covering term packing roundtrip, heap primitives, the four
  high-level constructors, the heap snapshot, and the WNF stub
  passthrough.
- `wl/THVMLink/Tests/run.wls` is the test runner. It loads the
  paclet, invokes `TestReport` on every `*.wlt` file, prints
  `wl tests: N passed, M failed` to stdout, lists each failed test,
  and exits non-zero on any failure.
- `wl/GUIDE.md` records WL style rules: no `Print` (use a local
  `debugPrint` wrapping `WriteString`), no em dashes, no Unicode
  box-drawing characters, no decorative arrows in source.
- `Makefile` gains `make wl` (build the dylib at
  `wl/THVMLink/LibraryResources/$(WL_PLATFORM)/THVMLink.dylib`) and
  `make wl-test` (run `run.wls`). Auto-detects the newest
  `/Applications/Wolfram*.app`; override with
  `WOLFRAM_APP=/Applications/Wolfram\ X.Y.app`.

### Added: scaffold (PLAN.md steps 0-3)

- `AGENTS.md` with conventions (path-is-the-function-name, single TU,
  one-interaction-per-file), build/test instructions, and a code map.
- `.gitignore` covering `bin/`, `*.o`, `*.dylib`, macOS `.DS_Store`,
  the local-only `.claude/` settings dir, and the `TinyHVM` reference
  symlink.
- `Makefile` with `make` (build all), `make test` (build + run tests),
  `make clean`. Tests are independent C programs that include
  `src/thvm.c`.
- `src/thvm.h` declaring the term bit layout (SUB:1 / TAG:7 / EXT:18 /
  VAL:38), the minimal tag set (APP, LAM, VAR, ERA, DP0, DP1, SUP,
  DUP), heap globals, and function signatures for the
  term/heap/wnf/interact modules.
- `src/thvm.c` single-TU hub that `#include`s all `.c` files in build
  order.
- `src/term/{new,tag,ext,val}.c` and `src/term/sub/{get,set}.c`:
  full implementations of term packing/unpacking. Trivial
  bit-twiddling.
- `src/heap/{alloc,read,set,take,subst_var}.c`: flat single-threaded
  bump-allocated heap with substitution helper.
- `src/wnf/_.c`: WNF stack machine **stub** that returns its input
  unchanged. Step 6 will replace this with the real reducer.
- `src/interact/app_lam.c`: APP-LAM beta reduction **stub**. Step 6
  fills it in.
- `tests/test_term.c`: round-trip test for `term_new` and
  `term_tag/ext/val/sub_get`. 73 checks pass.
- `tests/test_heap.c`: alloc-then-read-back, set-then-read-back. 9
  checks pass.
- `tests/test_app_lam.c`, `tests/test_era.c`, `tests/test_dup_sup.c`:
  carry the spec for APP-LAM beta, ERA propagation, and DUP-SUP
  collapse/commute. Bodies are gated by `PENDING(...)` until step 6
  lands `wnf` and the interactions, so they exit 0 today and report
  `pend` in `make test` output.
- `README.md` describing what works today and what is stubbed.
